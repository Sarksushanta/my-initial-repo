# Looks to be a simple change. I shall be able to complete soon.

Working on this but taking more time.

I need to work on a new priroty fix but want to keep the current changes safe and secure

Commiting the changes in master and then

Moving to quickfix branch...

Getting some time out to work on this fix now.

Few issues got resolved but stuck in one more issues

The approach does not seems to work and may need to take a different route

Want to preserve this work so may be needed in other approach

Committing the changes to quick fix and then 

Move the work to secondquickfix branch...
